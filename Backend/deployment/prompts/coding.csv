Parse an ISO-8601 datetime string into a :class:`datetime.datetime`. An ISO-8601 datetime string consists of a date portion, followed optionally by a time portion - the date and time portions are separated by a single character separator, which is ``T`` in the official standard. Incomplete date formats (such as ``YYYY-MM``) may *not* be combined with a time portion. Supported date formats are: Common: - ``YYYY`` - ``YYYY-MM`` or ``YYYYMM`` - ``YYYY-MM-DD`` or ``YYYYMMDD`` Uncommon: - ``YYYY-Www`` or ``YYYYWww`` - ISO week (day defaults to 0) - ``YYYY-Www-D`` or ``YYYYWwwD`` - ISO week and day The ISO week and day numbering follows the same logic as the function `datetime.date.isocalendar`. Supported time formats are: - ``hh`` - ``hh:mm`` or ``hhmm`` - ``hh:mm:ss`` or ``hhmmss`` - ``hh:mm:ss.ssssss`` (Up to 6 sub-second digits). Midnight is a special case for `hh`, as the standard supports both 00:00 and 24:00 as a representation. The decimal separator can be either a dot or a comma. Note that Support for fractional components other than seconds is part of the ISO-8601 standard, but does not have to be implemented in this parser. Supported time zone offset formats are:- `Z` (UTC) - `HH:MM` - `HHMM` - `HH` Offsets will be represented as :class:`dateutil.tz.tzoffset` objects, with the exception of UTC, which will be represented as :class:`dateutil.tz.tzutc`. Time zone offsets equivalent to UTC (such nas `+00:00`) will also be represented as :class:`dateutil.tz.tzutc`. Unspecified components default to their lowest value. The function signature is: def isoparse(self, dt_str):. The function has access (but does not necessarily use) the following packages: functools re calendar datetime functools six datetime. "

Parse the date/time string into a :class:`datetime.datetime` object. Can be optionally given a default datetime object, if this datetime object is not ``None``, elements specified in time string replace elements in the default object. Can also be optionally given the option to ignore time zones in parsed strings, then a naive :class:`datetime.datetime` object is returned. Can be optionally given additional time zone names / aliases which may be present in the string. This argument maps time zone names (and optionally offsets from those time zones) to time zones. This parameter can be a dictionary with timezone aliases mapping time zone names to time zones or a function taking two parameters (``tzname`` and ``tzoffset``) and returning a time zone. The timezones to which the names are mapped can be an integer offset from UTC in seconds or a :class:`tzinfo` object. This parameter is ignored if the option to ignore the time zones is set. Return a :class:`datetime.datetime` object or, if the ``fuzzy_with_tokens`` option is ``True``, returns a tuple, the first element being a :class:`datetime.datetime` object, the second a tuple containing the fuzzy tokens. Raise a ParserError for invalid or unknown string format, if the provided time zone is not in a valid format, or if an invalid date would be created. Raise a TypeError for non-string or character stream input. Raise an OverflowError if the parsed date exceeds the largest valid C integer on your system.

Get the value from environment given a matcher containing a name and an optional default value in its group dict. If the variable is not defined in environment and no default value is provided, an Error is raised. The function signature is: def _resolve_string(matcher):.

Given a sequence of configuration filenames, load and validate each configuration file. If the configuration file cannot be read due to insufficient permissions or error parsing configuration file, the error log will be recorded. Otherwise, return the results as a tuple of: dict of configuration filename to corresponding parsed configuration, and sequence of logging.LogRecord instances containing any parse errors. The function signature is: def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):. The function has access (but does not necessarily use) the following packages: logging. "

Current context is reset to an empty dict, bins of the class are reinitialized with the *initial_value* or with *make_bins()*. The function signature is: def reset(self):.

Convert graph's points to CSV. header, if not ``None``, is the first string of the output
(new line is added automatically). Since a graph can be multidimensional, for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by a separator), then each part of its value. To convert :class:`Graph` to CSV inside a Lena sequence, use :class:`lena.output.ToCSV`. The function signature is: def to_csv(self, separator="","", header=None):.

Update context with the properties of this graph.

context.error is appended with indices of errors.
Example subcontext for a graph with fields ""E,t,error_E_low"":
{""error"": {""x_low"": {""index"": 2}}}. Note that error names are called ""x"", ""y"" and ""z""
(this corresponds to first three coordinates,
if they are present), which allows to simplify plotting. Existing values are not removed from context.value and its subcontexts. Called on ""destruction"" of the graph. By destruction we mean conversion to another structure (like text) in the flow. The graph object is not really destroyed in this process. The function signature is: def _update_context(self, context):. The function has access (but does not necessarily use) the following packages: warnings operator functools re copy lena functools. "
